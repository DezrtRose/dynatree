The main things that should be addressed are
  * The interface, usage, naming conventions, etc. could probably be more jQuery-ish.
    Any feedback from experienced plugin developers is very welcome!
  * So far I am only testing Windows, IE 7 and FF 3. Maybe a little bit of IE 6/8, Safari and FF2.
  * The code should be hosted more community friendly. Also some forum and issue tracker should be available.
  * The internal implementation of dynatree could make more use of jQuery technique.
    So far it's based on the lazytree implementations which was indepent of any library.

#summary Main topics to address in the future.

There is no real roadmap so far.

Bugs should be handled in the issue tracker.

The main things that should be addressed are

  * The interface, usage, naming conventions, etc. could probably be more jQuery-ish.
    Any feedback from experienced plugin developers is very welcome!
  * So far I am only testing Windows, IE 7 and FF 3. Maybe a little bit of IE 6/8, Safari and FF2.
  * The internal implementation of dynatree could make more use of jQuery technique.
    So far it's based on the lazytree implementations which was indepent of any library.

==== Release 0.4 ====

NOTE: This is under development (ALPHA status).
See UpdateToVersion04 for some infos.

===== Main changes =====
  * 'selected'/'select' was renamed to 'active'/'activate'<br>This is more precise and allowed implementation of the new selection feature.
  * Selection support<br>Avable  mode: single selection, multi selection and multi-hierarchical.
  * Support for checkboxes
  * Changed syntax when initializing from a UL tag.<br>Most status information can now be passed in the {{{class}}} attribute, e.g {{{class='expanded selected focused active lazy folder'}}}.<br>The {{{data}}} attribute is not valid in strict html and may be avoided most of the time. It is still supported however, and may be used to attach additional custom data to the nodes.
  * Persistence was extended to active, focus, expand and selection status.<br>Also, it is no longer required define node-keys, because dummy keys are generated by default.
  * New API functions like {{{$("#tree").disable()}}}, {{{tree.visit()}}}, ...
  * New callbacks like {{{onClick(dtnode, event)}}}, {{{onQueryActivate(activate, dtnode)}}}, and {{{onActivate(dtnode)}}}.
  * The tree images are now defined in CSS, instead of image name options.
  * New {{{fx}}} option for animation effects when expanding/collapsing.

Dynatree is based on [http://wwWendt.de/tech/lazytree lazytree 0.2].
I had to rename it, because there already was a jQuery plugin named _lazytree_.

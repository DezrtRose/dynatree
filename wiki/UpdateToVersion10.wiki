#summary Migration hints for updating from 0.5 to 1.0.

*Note: 1.0 is not yet released!*


When updating from version 0.5 to 1.0, the following aspects have changed and may have to be adjusted.
Main Changes:
  * Build against jQuery 1.4 and jQuery UI 1.8
  * New HTML markup<br>Using `<ul>/<li>` for faster expand / collapse and smoother effects
  * Support for drag'n'drop<br>Compatible with jquery.ui.draggable/.droppable but more efficient for a large number of nodes.
  * Faster benchmarks
  * Modified css<br>ui-dynatree-document -> ui-dynatree-node<br>Class ui-dynatree-folder is now *additionally* set (together with ui-dynatree-node)<br>rename classes 'ui-dynatree-...' -> 'dynatree-...'
  * Always hide root node.<br>Removed tree.rootVisible (now always hidden)<br>Removed tree.title.
  * tree.minExpandLevel must be >= 1<br>If a single visible root is wanted, one could always create one using`<ul>`Top level node expanders are not connected by vlines (requires additional expander icon).<br>If minExpandLevel>=1, also the expander icons are hidden, so the first icon column can be removed.
  * Implemented Unit Testing
  * opts.generateIds: false
  * All  callbacks have the Dynatree instance as 'this'
  * hasChildren: return 'undefined' if node is unexpanded lazy, or only contains one status node
  * Changed node.visit(fn, data, includeSelf) -> node.visit(fn, includeSelf)
    visit() now returns nothing.
    If the callback function returns false, the the traversal is stopped. 
    If the callback function returns 'skip', the the traversal of the current branch is stopped. 
   (Changes apply also for tree.visit())
  * renamed node.reload() --> reloadChildren()
  * renamed dtnode -> node in the samples  
  * Distinguish for lazy nodes
    childList == null: 'never loaded'
    childList == []: 'loaded, but node has no children'
  * 'noLink' option is available for nodes or the whole tree.


New functions:
  * node.isStatusNode()
  * node.isChildOf(otherNode)
  * node.isDescendantOf(otherNode)
  * node.move(targetNode, mode)
  * node.visitParents(fn, includeSelf)
  * node.sortChildren(cmp, deep)
  * New tree.disable(), .enable() (shortcut for $("#tree").dynatree("disable"))
  * getChildren(), getParent(), getPrevSibling(), getNextSibling()
  * scheduleAction()
